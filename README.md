# seed-to-public

This is a small ugly electron app I made to check the public key that comes from you Internet Identity (identity.ic0.app) seedphrase. It just puts some function together from the Internet Identity codebase.

I can only promise that I am not trying to steal your seed phrase myself intentionally. I could have made some coding mistake or my github could have been hacked causing you seed phrase to leak. Use at your own risk. 

To run from source have node and npm installed on your system and simply run:
- npm install
- npm start
